Create a personal finance tracker application tailored for an investor and trader in cryptocurrencies, stocks, virtual gold, and silver, using Rust for backend logic and Slint UI for the frontend dashboard.

Key Features:
Daily Investment Data Input:
Allow users to input or import daily snapshots of their investments, including amount invested, current value, and asset type.

Daily Profit & Loss Calculation:
Automatically calculate daily profit and loss for each asset by comparing the current day’s value with the previous day’s data.

Total Wealth Tracking:
Display the total current wealth by aggregating values from all asset classes, updated daily.

Data Visualization:

Show daily profit and loss in both tabular form and interactive line/bar charts.

Visualize total wealth over time with smooth, intuitive trend graphs.

Include portfolio allocation pie charts by asset category for easy overview.

Customizable Dashboard:
Build a modern, clean, and user-friendly interface using Slint UI, enabling users to customize widgets and layout for quick access to key metrics.

Backend & Data Management:
Utilize Rust with async support (e.g., Tokio) for efficient data processing, storage, and real-time updates.
Support data import/export (CSV preferred). Store data locally or with lightweight embedded databases like sled or rusqlite.

Graphing Tools:
Use Rust-native visualization libraries such as plotters, egui_plot, or others compatible with Slint to render charts and graphs seamlessly within the UI.

Security:
Implement secure user authentication for data privacy.
